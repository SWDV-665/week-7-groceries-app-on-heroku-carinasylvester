Unfortunately, mLab no longer supports MongoDB
and the alternative add-on I could find was
ObjectRocket for MongoDB (which is a paid add-on).

Since I still wanted to complete this assignment,
I decided to use MongoDB Atlas instead, and integrate
it with Heroku. Basically, I did this by creating an Atlas cluster
and set its connection string to a Heroku config variable.

I hope my alternative solution is acceptable.
